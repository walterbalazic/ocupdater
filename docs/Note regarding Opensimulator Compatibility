Opensimulator will not allow couples animation and leash to co-exist within the collar.  Do NOT include 
couplesanim script in the collar build or leashing will fail forcing user to completely log out and
reset the collar in it's entiretly.  This has been investigated by several scripters and there is 
currently no workaround for this due to the ODE physics engine present in Opensimulator.
